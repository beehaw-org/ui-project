# ui-project
Alternative frontend for Lemmy

## Goals

* Drop-in replacement for lemmy-ui
* Focus on UX
* Accessible for contributions
* Small list of dependencies

## Running locally

### Requirements

You must have nodejs available locally to run the dev server. You can either use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
which automates downloading and installing the correct version of nodejs, or you can manually see what version you need
from the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) file and install it yourself.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i
# run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
